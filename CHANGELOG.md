Created with <3 by your friendly ghost.

## Change Log:

### v1.0.7

- Fixed color bug, that led to colorAlpha overwiting Colors for later Stuctures.

### v1.0.6

- Added Beziercurve and ExpCurve, which is basically a Beziercurve with one instead of 2 Control Points.
- Sort Walls in the helix by z, so the colors don't get mixed up now.
